# Palindrome Products

Write a program that can detect palindrome products in a given range.

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome
made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 x 99.

## Running tests

```bash
$ elixir bob_test.exs
```

(Replace `bob_test.exs` with the name of the test file.)
